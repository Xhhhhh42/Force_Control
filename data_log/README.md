- Traj 1: Start Pose bad, blocked by the table or reach Joint / Velocity limits.

    ( The following same reason will not be repeated )

- Traj 2: Start Pose bad.

- Traj 3: Error: joint_velocity_violation.

- Traj 4: Error: joint_velocity_violation.

- Traj 5: Trajectory  is blocked by Gripper.

    ( __Top 3__, recommand params: slow_factor = 2 )

    **⚠️Warning⚠️**: Iteration num: 15562 Collision Risk!!!!
